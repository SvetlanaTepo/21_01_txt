During the class we firstly talked about our future dream projects, and whether we are interested in hardware, software or game development.
In the next step instructor told us what kind of operational system we need to install and have in our computers , so that we can work with terminal and learn the
basics of C language.
Instructor suggested us to choose Unix/ Linux OS, Vim/ text editor, commands and gcc.
Then, we discussed the main properties of language C, Python and Java which is kind of the mixture of this two.
In the rest part of the class we talked about CPU, GPU and other important parts of the course.

# 23.01

During this class we mainly focused on learning about Linux and Unix. We began by reviewing both operating systems and discussing their similarities and differences. 
While Linux is modeled after Unix, it stands out for being free, open-source, and highly flexible, making it a popular choice for various applications. After 
understanding their distinctions, we moved on to exploring essential Linux commands such as ls, mkdir, cp, cd, and many others. This session provided a foundational 
understanding of how these commands are used to navigate and manage files within the Linux environment.

# 30.01
The class was focused on number systems and their connection to computers. We started by discussing binary numbers, how they are added, and their role 
in representing visuals and images on a screen. This exploration helped us understand how computers process and display information. Toward the end of the class, we
shifted to learning about Git, including some essential Git commands and how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration. This session effectively combined 
theoretical concepts with practical tools used in computing.

# 04.02
The lesson was about the introduction to data types and how information is represented. We were introduced to the concept of ontology. 
After that, we moved on to algorithms, discussing how they can be represented and developing several algorithms to solve different problems.  The programs included 
tasks like finding the sum of even numbers up to 100 and reversing a given number.
This class effectively connected the  theoretical concepts with practical programming skills.

# 06.02
The session on February 6 focused on introducing the commands and structures of the C programming language. We started by learning about control flow,
which is essential for determining how a programâ€™s instructions are executed. The discussion covered various programming concepts, including functions, if-else 
statements, switch-case structures, and different types of loops such as while and for loops. By exploring these concepts, we gained a better understanding of how 
to write programs that can make decisions, repeat tasks, and manage complex operations efficiently.

# 11.02
The lesson introduced us to pointers and the concept of dereferencing, which is crucial for working with memory addresses directly. We explored how pointers and 
arrays are closely related and practiced using them in code to manipulate data more efficiently. Understanding how to declare, initialize, and access arrays, along
with proper pointer usage, gave us valuable insight into memory management in C programming.

# 13.02
We continued our discussion on dynamic arrays in C, building upon what we had previously learned. We focused more deeply on how to allocate and deallocate memory 
for managing memory efficiently. The lesson also covered common mistakes to avoid when working with dynamic arrays and pointers, such as memory leaks and 
segmentation faults.

# 18.02

We learned how to work with files in C, which is essential for handling data storage. We were introduced to file handling functions such as fopen() for opening 
files, fclose() for closing them, and other related commands used for reading from and writing to files. The lesson emphasized how to properly manage files to 
prevent errors and ensure data integrity. We also practiced used these commands in simple programs.

# 20.02
We focused on bitwise operations in C, which are essential for performing low-level data manipulation. Additionally, we explored the various bitwise operators like 
AND, OR, XOR, and shifts, and learned how they can be used to modify individual bits in data. We worked through examples and practice problems to ensure a solid 
understanding of bitwise operations and how they can be applied in programming. 

# 25.02

The class covered important concepts in programming, such as the difference between local and global variables, and how each type of variable is used within a 
program. Additionally, we learned about debug mode and release mode, understanding their roles in the development process and how they affect the behavior and 
performance of our programs. 

# 27.02

 The class introduced us to the concepts of threads and mutexes, which are crucial for handling concurrency in programming. We discussed how threads allow for 
 parallel execution of tasks and how mutexes are used to prevent data corruption by managing access to shared resources. 

 # 04.03
 The session focused on how to implement threads in code and manage synchronization using mutexes to prevent conflicts when multiple threads access shared 
 resources. We also worked on practical examples to better understand how to apply these concepts in real life.

 # 06.03

 We had a session with our Program Chair. She emphasized the importance of clearly defining  requirements to ensure a successful presentation. Additionally, there 
 were demonstrated a few examples of product documentation, showing us what key elements it should contain. In the end we had some interacting activity (during 
 which we draw a house).

 # 18.03 
 As there was upcoming midterm, the class was mainly used to discuss and solve some problems, while using all the knowledge that we gained during several weeks. 
 The problems were mainly based on basic function and very similar to homework 1 problems.

 # 20.03 
 We wrote our midterm that was consisting of 5 problems related to topics we had learned throughout the first half of the semester.

 # 25.03
 We discussed the problems from the midterm and solved them together.

 # 27.03
 On March 27 we talked about FSM and wrote a program for traffic light simulation using learned method.

 # 01.04
 During April 1 class we learned a new topics - structures. We talked about their properties and applicatons in code.

 # 03.04
We learned about file connections in C, the concept of .h and .c files, their properties, purposes and how they work.

# 08.04
We continued last class' topic of file connections and writing a library and continued working on fucntions in our self-made string library.

# 10.04
We finished the file connections topic and discussed the FSM again as our homework was related to it.

# 15.04
We discussed our final project ideas with our program chair, Ms.Satenik and helped each other to better define the scope and requirements.

# 17.04
We talked about building our own libraries and how to implement structures and pointers to structures in them.

# 29.04 
We discussed lists, how they are working and how to deal with them.

# 06.05
During May 6 class we learned about various sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, etc.

# 13.05
We continued the topic of lists and their implementation. Unfortunately, we didn't manage to cover the final exam topics.
