During the class we firstly talked about our future dream projects, and whether we are interested in hardware, software or game development.
In the next step instructor told us what kind of operational system we need to install and have in our computers , so that we can work with terminal and learn the basics of C language.
Instructor suggested us to choose Unix/ Linux OS, Vim/ text editor, commands and gcc.
Then, we discussed the main properties of language C, Python and Java which is kind of the mixture of this two.
In the rest part of the class we talked about CPU, GPU and other important parts of the course.
